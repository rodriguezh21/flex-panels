## Description

Project 5/30. In this project, we go over flex boxes and panels to create a nice and neat opening and closing effect as well as font-size and flex-grow when each panel is clicked. Fun and easy project learning the basics of vanilla JavaScript, a creative course imparted by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos).
